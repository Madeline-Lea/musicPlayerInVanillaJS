## Menu & Functionalities

The menu consist in three buttons with a Music Player function as:

	prev = Change the song to previous one.
	
	play = It stop and resume the music on playing.

	next = Change the song to next one.
	
## How to add songs into the Player.

To insert a new song on queue you need to add your song in a array called "songs" and change something

	const songs = ["intoToDust", "you", "videoTape"];
	
	// I highly recommend to put a name like camelPhase.

	let songIndex = 2
